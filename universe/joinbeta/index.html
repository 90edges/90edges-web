                We will process &quot;orders&quot; in the order of your subscriptions. When time comes you will receive an email with instructions how to subscribe for monthly payments (we will use excellent <a href="http://www.fastspring.com/">FastSpring.com</a> solution for this) and how to enter the game. We will provide you at least <b>7-Day Money Back Guarantee</b> and you may cancel monthly subscription at any time. Canceling subscription is a good news for other potential players waiting in the list for free positions!
